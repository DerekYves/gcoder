# r_geo_code
Provides methods to geocode an address in R using Google's (paid) Google for Work service.

I created this passage because I was unable to use my enterprise's private key to properly encode URL requests to the Google Maps API (i.e., the non-free version of the service). 

At the moment I focus only on geocode requests, but other features could be added (feel free to fork!).
