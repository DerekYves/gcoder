# r_geo_code
Provides methods to geocode an address in R using Google's (paid) Google for Work service.

I created this package because I was unable to use my enterprise's private Google API key to properly encode URL requests to the Google Maps API (i.e., the non-free version of the service). At the moment I've only created a method to form geocode requests, but other features could be added (feel free to make suggestions!).
